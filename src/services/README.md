# Services Directory

This directory contains service modules that handle API calls and external interactions.

## Guidelines

- Each service file should focus on a specific domain or external service
- Use consistent error handling and response processing
- Abstract away implementation details to provide a clean API
- Document each function with JSDoc comments including parameters and return types
