# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable UI components that are used across multiple features.

## Structure

- `/ui`: Basic UI elements like buttons, cards, inputs, etc.
- `/forms`: Form components and form-related elements
- `/navigation`: Navigation components like navbar, sidebar, etc.
- `/feedback`: User feedback components like alerts, toasts, loaders, etc.

## Guidelines

- Components should be reusable and decoupled from business logic
- Each component should have a clear, single responsibility
- Component files should export a single component as default
- Complex components can have their own directory with sub-components
