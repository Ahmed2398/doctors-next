# Lib Directory

This directory contains utility functions, helpers, and libraries used throughout the application.

## Structure

- `/utils`: General utility functions
- `/formatters`: Functions for formatting data (dates, currency, etc.)
- `/validators`: Validation functions and schemas

## Guidelines

- Functions should be pure and focused on a single responsibility
- Functions should be well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Organize related functions into logical groups
- Export individual functions rather than objects with multiple methods
