# Hooks Directory

This directory contains global custom hooks used across multiple features.

## Guidelines

- Place feature-specific hooks in the feature's own `/hooks` directory
- Only place hooks here if they are used by multiple features
- Each hook should be in its own file and follow the `use[Name]` convention
- Document the purpose, parameters, and return value of each hook
